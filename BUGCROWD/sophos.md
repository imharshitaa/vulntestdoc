---------------------------

1 - automated Tested on zap active scan - showed alert server leaks version information on HTTP response header - server name details.

2 - inspect page html head code - Cross-Domain JavaScript Source Inclusion - external javascript without validation.

3 - inspec page html head code - JavaScript Dependency Vulnerabilities - external domain source without validating.

4 - from zap alert for cross domain javascript source file inclusion - content security policy headers not mentioned which could lead to potential XSS Attacks. 
potential information leakage for id data and cause unauthorized access. 

5 - mfa not supported causing unauthorized access.

6 - potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability reflected - on login page - input field accepts the payload script tag - error message reflects the same input - might allow to inject malicious scripts in user input. 

7 - cross domain misconfiguration - header access control allow origin * - leads to unauthorized access to any source API or domain.

This report documents multiple security vulnerabilities identified during testing on the application. Each vulnerability is described along with evidence, potential impacts, and recommendations for remediation.

# 1. Server Information Disclosure

Description: Automated tests using OWASP ZAP revealed that the server leaks version information in the HTTP response header.
Impact: Information disclosure may help attackers identify potential vulnerabilities in specific versions of the server software.
Recommendation: Remove or obfuscate server version details in HTTP headers to mitigate this risk.
Evidence: ![1 zap test leak server details](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51f0a165-4ce9-4720-b13b-bbc9a566167d)

# 2. Cross-Domain JavaScript Source Inclusion
Description: The inspected page HTML head contains external JavaScript sources without proper validation.
Impact: This could lead to the inclusion of malicious scripts and compromise the integrity of the application.
Recommendation: Implement validation for external JavaScript sources and utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) to ensure safe inclusion.
Evidence: ![2 external javascript without validation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2df05fec-8e51-4b06-9342-39d7626ce3d1)

# 3. JavaScript Dependency Vulnerabilities
Description: The page includes JavaScript dependencies from external domains without validating their integrity.
Impact: This may expose the application to vulnerabilities present in those dependencies, potentially compromising user data.
Recommendation: Review and validate all third-party JavaScript libraries, and consider using a trusted content delivery network (CDN).
Evidence: ![3 javascript dependency vuln external domain](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da0e8243-0d4b-4dbe-a890-923f8c5ec0aa)

# 4. Missing Content Security Policy (CSP)
Description: Alerts from ZAP indicated that the application lacks Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
Impact: The absence of CSP could lead to XSS attacks and potential information leakage, particularly regarding sensitive identifiers.
Recommendation: Implement a robust CSP to control the sources of content that can be executed, thus reducing the risk of XSS.
Evidence: ![4 security headers not mentioned   client id info leaked](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/990ec7d9-9e43-4083-b884-ddf122ba97fb)

# 5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Not Supported
Description: The application does not support Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), increasing the risk of unauthorized access.
Impact: Without MFA, the application is more susceptible to unauthorized access and account takeover attacks.
Recommendation: Implement MFA to enhance account security and protect user data.
Evidence: ![5 MFA LACKING](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fc4574c-69a3-48c5-b0ae-94bab885427d)

# 6. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Description: The login page reflects user input without proper sanitization, leading to a potential XSS vulnerability.
Impact: An attacker could exploit this to inject malicious scripts, potentially hijacking user sessions or redirecting users to harmful sites.
Recommendation: Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
Evidence: ![6 reflected xss attack user input display error message](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2070ffd9-889d-48cd-81e5-4faede58c059)

# 7. CORS Misconfiguration
Description: The applicationâ€™s Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is set to *, allowing any origin to access its resources.
Impact: This misconfiguration can lead to unauthorized access to APIs and data exposure.
Recommendation: Restrict the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to trusted domains only.
Evidence: ![7 CORS header - unauthorized access to API - domains](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec8bb199-41b0-4c34-908d-66b2d7e6a82e)
